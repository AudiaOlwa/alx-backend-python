# Unittests and Integration Tests

## Project Overview
This project introduces **unit testing** and **integration testing** in Python.  
You will learn how to:
- Differentiate between unit tests and integration tests
- Apply common testing patterns such as mocking, parametrization, and fixtures
- Write clean and maintainable test files using the `unittest` framework

All tasks must follow Pythonâ€™s `pycodestyle` and include proper documentation.

- All files must be executable
- All modules, classes, and functions must have documentation
- All functions and coroutines must include type annotations
- Tests should be run with:
